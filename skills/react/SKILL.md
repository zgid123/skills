description: Guidelines for writing consistent, type-safe React components in Alpha's projects. Use when creating, reviewing, or refactoring React components, hooks, props interfaces, or JSX structure.

# Purpose

This skill defines how to write and structure React components so that code is type-safe, readable, and consistent across Alpha's projects. All rules here extend and respect the TypeScript skill — read `skills/typescript/SKILL.md` and its references first.

# General Principles

- **Extend the TypeScript skill**: every rule from `skills/typescript/SKILL.md` applies to React files unless explicitly overridden here.
- **Feature-based structure**: organise code by domain area under `src/features/<feature>/`. Each feature contains four sub-folders — `components/` (pure presentational), `hooks/` (shared hooks used by two or more consumers), `utils/` (pure helpers), and `widgets/` (smart containers that wire hooks into components). A hook used by only one component or widget is co-located with that file, not placed in `hooks/`. Shared components used across features live in `src/components/`.
- **Function declarations for components**: always define components with the `function` keyword, never as arrow function constants assigned to a variable.
- **Named exports only**: always export components with `export function`. `export default` is only allowed in framework router files that require it (Next.js page/layout files, TanStack Start route files).
- **Explicit JSX return type**: every component must declare at least `JSX.Element` as its return type. Use `JSX.Element | null` when the component can render nothing.
- **Named imports only**: import React APIs by name. Never use `import * as React from 'react'` or rely on a global React namespace.
- **Props interface naming**: the props interface for a component named `Foo` must be named `IFooProps`.
