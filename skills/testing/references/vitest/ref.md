# Vitest guideline

Vitest is the default test runner for all JavaScript and TypeScript projects that follow Alpha's
standards. Use it together with the generic testing skill (`SKILL.md`) for unit, integration, and
E2E tests.

## Philosophy (JS/TS)

- Do **not** mock internal classes, functions, or modules just to make tests easier.
- Only stub or mock **3rd‑party requests** and external services.
- Prefer HTTP‑level mocking with **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** for outbound network calls.

## File locations and naming

- All test files live under `src/__tests__`.
- Unit and integration tests: `*.spec.ts`.
- End‑to‑end tests: `*.e2e.ts`.

## Detailed guides

- [Convention](./convention.md) — how to structure and name test suites.
- [Factory](./factory.md) — creating reusable factories with `fishery` and `@faker-js/faker`.
- [Integration test](./integration-test.md) — examples using Drizzle repositories with Vitest.
- [End‑to‑end test](./end-to-end-test.md) — examples using Hono + Drizzle with Vitest.
